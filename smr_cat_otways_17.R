## BACKGROUND
# this code builds MLE spatial mark-resight models (sighting-only) for feral cats in the Otway Ranges, VIC, AUS - from 1 survey in 2017. 
# we used camera-traps and natural coat markings to identify cats
# this is not the exact code used for https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108287, but an updated script with the following changes:
# 1) blurry tabby cats correctly placed as tn - mark status unknown (thanks to Joanne Potts for picking this error up)
# 2) camera-trap grids seperated by being different sessions, rather than using a habitat mask with covariate
# 3) "fastproximity = FALSE" arguement in models with time covariates as well as models which are being compared to time covariates (necessary due to change in default settings in the new secr package) 
# NOTE: these changes have no effect on the results - all results presented in Rees et al. 2019 are correct.

#save.image("workspace.RData")
load("workspace.RData")

# note 1: to reduce temporal autocorrelation: all individuals / mark types detections have been reduced to a binary 0-1 per camera-trap per [24-hour] occasion. 
# note 2: in the previous version of this script tn cats were incorrectly put as tm - this did effect the results because pID was fixed to 1 (excluding these cats from the models - as they should be). It is very unlikely to have have tn individuals using natural marks.
trapfile <- "data/trap.txt"                                     # trap coordinates and usage

tu <- as.matrix(read.csv("data/unmarked_dethist.csv")[, -1])    # unmarked cats
tn <- as.matrix(read.csv("data/unknown_dethist.csv")[, -1])     # marked status unknown (blurry tabby cats) - these cats do not get used in the density estimate, just reported in the model summary

## MAKE CAPTHIST FILE 
# note 1: we use proximity detectors instead of count detectors (a) to reduce temporal autocorrelation (see above note), (b) because we had variable usage and were modelling time-based covariates. Otherwise we would have condensed to 1 occasion and used count detectors. 
# note 2: this data is currently formatted in one combined session - with 72 occasions overall. This is sighting-only mark-resight so all occasions need to be specified as sighting occasions (0). 
CH <- read.capthist(captfile = captfile, trapfile = trapfile, detector = "proximity", markocc = rep(0, 72))

# add un unmarked and unknown sightings 
# note - tn detections are often combined with tu detections, however, in our case it is conservative to underestimate cat density (see Rees et al. 2019)
MRCH <- addSightings(CH, unmarked = tu, nonID = NULL, uncertain = tn)

# split camera-trap into two sessions to distinguish them (in the previous version of this script - I seperated grids with habitat mask - but this is quicker / simpler)
